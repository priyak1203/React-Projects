Scroll Photos solution

Initially fetch is called twice because of React.Strictmode version 18 changes.

State Values used 
loading - checks whether the data is being fetched.
photos - used to store the results.
page - points to the current page.
query - used to store search value or string.
newImages - indicated when the scroll end has reached and time to fetch the data.
mounted - helps to avoid running of useEffect on initial render for scroll functionality.

fetchImages 
- url is constructed based on whether the search value is present or not. 
- if there is query and page is 1 then remove the old results and replace it with the current 
result, else append the result to the end of the array.


useEffect 1 - dependency array - page
-runs on initial render and every time the page value changes.
- fetch the images.

useEffect 2 - dependency array - newImages 
- ideally runs on initial render and every time the newImages value changes.
- do not want it to run on initial render.
- want it to run only when newImages is true.

logic
- check mounted value,  if false set it to true and return; 
this avoids running the useEffect on inital render.
- check loading if true then return
this avoids running the useEffect when the data is being fetched.
- check newImages if false then return
this avoids running the useEffect when newImages value is false.
increment the page value by 1, this triggers the first useEffect and images are fetched as 
a result of that. 


scrollEvent
- checks whether the scroll has reached the end of the page
- window.innerHeight+ window.scrollY >= document.body.scrollHeight - 2
set newImages to true if the scroll has reached the end of the page.

useEffect 3 - dependency array - []
- runs on initial render and all the renders.
- listen for the scroll event, also write the clean up function by removing the eventlistener.

handleSubmit
- runs when the form is submitted.
- if there is no query then do nothing and return
- if page is 1 then fetchImages. 
By default page is 1, so the first useEffect will not run on first submit. 
therefore fetch images directly when page is 1.
- if page is not 1 then setPage to 1 
This makes the search result to be displayed on the first page in case page value is not 1
when the query is submitted.
